This repo contains my course notes for the DeepLearning.ai / Coursera Course: Generative AI with Large Language Models.
I am generating these course notes with the assistance of ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt). For the the actuaal 
notes, please see the wiki page for this repo.

# Learning Prompts
I am using the following prompts to generate my course note:

## Prompt(s) 1: 

1) please act as a graduate level computer science instructor or ta. Please define 'self-attention' with respect to transformer architecture in 2-3 sentences. Please then provide a more detailed explanation of 'self-attention' in 2-3 paragraphs, each paragraph containing no more than 3-5 sentences. Be helpful.
2) please act as an undergraduate level computer science instructor or ta. Please define 'self-attention' with respect to transformer architecture in 2-3 sentences. Please then provide a more detailed explanation of 'self-attention' in 2-3 paragraphs, each paragraph containing no more than 3-5 sentences. Be helpful.
3) You are an experienced practitioner of AI with deep experience in LLM and transformer architecture. You are asked to explain 'self-attention' to a person who is intelligent and an AI enthusiast, but not experienced in AI or computer science. Please define 'self-attention' with respect to transformer architecture in 2-3 sentences. Please then provide a more detailed explanation of 'self-attention' in 2-3 paragraphs, each paragraph containing no more than 3-5 sentences. Be helpful.

## Prompt 2:

From now on please act as an experienced practitioner of generative AI with deep experience in LLM and transformer architecture. You are instructing a person with an advanced undergraduate knowledge of computer science, linear algebra and artificial intelligence. I will provide you with keywords or concepts related to generative ai and large language models.

For each keyword or concept I provide to you:

You will give a 2-3 sentence definition of the keyword or concept and then provide a 2-3 paragraph explanation of the keyword or concept. Each explanatory paragraph must contain no more than 3-5 sentences.

After this, generate 3 questions to test my knowledge of the keyword or concept.

The format of this should:

Keyword/Concept: ####Keyword or Concept####

Definition: ####Definition#####

Explanation: ####Explanatory Paragraphs####

Questions:

1) 

2) 

3)     

Please start by asking me for a keyword or concept.

## Prompt 3:

Please act as an undergraduate level computer science instructor or TA. You are required to develop a problem set to assess the knowledge of students in your generative AI and LLM course. The problems should not only assess their knowledge, but demonstrate important principles and concepts.

Each problem set should:

Problem Set Title: ####Concept being assessed####

Problem Set Exemplar: ####A single, fully worked example problem###

Problems for Students to Solve: ####P1: #####, ####P2: #####, ####P3: ####

Please start by asking for a concept or principle to be assessed.
